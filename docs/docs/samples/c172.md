## Description
<img alt="c172.lua" src={require('./images/c172.jpg').default} width="400" align="right"/>

This script was written for Cessna 172 Skyhawk analogue instruments version that contains in delux edition.<br/>
This is the example how to implement reusable visual component. 
The following instruments are implemented as a component and each component written as one lua script placed at [samples/practical/lib/](https://github.com/opiopan/fsmapper/tree/main/samples/practical/lib/).

- Garmin GNS530 (GPS and NAVCOM)
- Garmin GNS430 (GPS and NAVCOM)
- Bendix King KAP 140 (Autopilot Control)
- Bendix King KT 76C (Transponder)
- Bendix King KR 87 (ADF)
- Heading Indicator with Heading Bug
- Cource Diviation Indicator
- ADF Indicator
- Buttons and Indicators whch is used to select navigation source (Sorry, I don't know the model name or official name)

This script defines three views. 
The above components are placed in different positions, different sizes, and different combinations on each view.<br/>
You can switch between these views with the switches placed on the left end and the right end of SimHID G1000 housing.

Almost component can be activated with tapping it. Component in active state can be distinguished by some areas turning emerald green.<br/>
A part of phisical buttons and knobs on SimHID G1000 will only affect component in active state.<br/>
For example, Course of CDI for NAV1 can be changed by rotationg course knob on SimHID G1000 only when CDI for NAV1 is activated.

Other various components can be found at [here](https://github.com/opiopan/scripts_for_fsmapper/tree/main/simhid_g1000/fs2020/lib).
