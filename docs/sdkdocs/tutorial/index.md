# Tutorials

This section provides step-by-step tutorials that walk through practical examples using the fsmapper Plugin SDK.

Each tutorial focuses on a different plugin approach supported by fsmapper:

- **[Custom Device Plugin tutorial](./custom_device.md)**  
  Learn how to implement a native plugin module that integrates with fsmapper’s device model, exposes device units, and interacts with Lua scripts through events and actions.

- **[Lua C Module tutorial](./lua_cmod.md)**  
  Learn how to extend fsmapper using a Lua C module, emit events asynchronously from native code, and exchange structured data with Lua scripts.

These tutorials are intended to complement the SDK reference documentation by showing how the concepts and APIs are used together in real implementations.
